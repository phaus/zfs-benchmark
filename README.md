# Some Details about this ZFS Benchmark

* All Tests were done on a Ubuntu 14.04 Linux System, since the Target Platform at the moment will be Proxmox. Of course you should always use an Illumos absed System, if you have the choice to do so!
* HW was a HP DL380.
* Due to the fact that the Test-Files should be the double of the RAM Size, the RAM was limited to 8GB. We might repeat the Test with a more realistic RAM SIZE (e.g. 16G, 32G, 64G, 72G) when there is more time to do this.
